STACK DIAGRAM:
main
recurse		n -> 3	s -> 0
recurse		n -> 2	s -> 3
recurse		n -> 1	s -> 5
recurse		n -> 0	s -> 6

1. If you call the function with n starting at -1 it will fall into an infinite recursion because the base case will never be met

2. 
""" A recurse function that prints the value of s once the value of n reaches 0 so long as the argument for n is >= 0 """
